D-VXLMapPreview
===============

Snappy name, I know.

Generates isometric preview images of VXL and Icemap maps for Ace of Spades and Iceball.

Warning: This is my first D project, used as an excuse to try out the language.
The code is possibly broken and/or includes a lot of bad practices.

TODO
----

 * The TODO comments in the source.
 * Allow use from Python somehow (build as C shared lib? pyd?)
 * Lighting?
